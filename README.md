Coursework from Udemy's https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2

The aim here is to teach yourself C# and Unity to build custom reinforcement learning environments. My inspiration comes directly from these videos:

Still trying to figure out the best way to work wiht Unity and github - at least for now it is kinda cumbersome.
